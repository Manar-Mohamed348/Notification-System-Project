## üìã Features

This project demonstrates four key JavaScript techniques:

1.  **Notification System**
    *   Simulate triggering multiple notifications.
    *   Clear all notifications with a single click.
    *   Real-time counter for total notifications.
    *   Displays a message when there are no notifications.

2.  **Debounced Search Field**
    *   Implements a search input with debouncing to optimize performance.
    *   Waits for the user to stop typing before executing the search.
    *   Displays dynamic, mock search results.

3.  **Throttled Scroll Position Logger**
    *   Tracks and displays the user's scroll position on the page.
    *   Uses throttling to limit scroll event handlers to a maximum of one execution per second.
    *   Scroll and check the browser's console to see the throttled updates.

4.  **Async Error Handling**
    *   Simulates fetching data from an API with a built-in 50% chance of failure.
    *   Demonstrates robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks with async/await or Promises.
    *   Provides user feedback for both successful and failed data fetch attempts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the application.
*   **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and visual feedback.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all interactive functionality and logic.
*   Key JavaScript Concepts:
    *   DOM Manipulation
    *   Event Handling
    *   Debounce Function
    *   Throttle Function
    *   Async/Await & Error Handling
    *   Closures
